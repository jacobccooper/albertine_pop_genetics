# Lacustrine Rift Population Genetics
Whole genome genetic analyses of select Lacustrine Rift (a.k.a. Albertine Rift) bird taxa. Code is based on that from JD Manthey's analyses on Picoides woodpeckers, with his permission: https://github.com/jdmanthey/dryobates_popgen (similar to https://github.com/jdmanthey/dryobates_population_genomics).
